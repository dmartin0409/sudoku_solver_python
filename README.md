# Sudoku Solver in Python

This is a program I decided to write because I was tired of getting stumped by
some of those pesky sudoku puzzles.

This program will take a string of 81 numbers, 0 to 9, for each cell.  It will then display 
the next number it solves and a brief method of how it solved it.

In its current form, it is not very pretty, but useful enough for me to know what it is doing.

It will solve the 1 million puzzles from a Kaggle competition.

It will, however, not solve some of the top 95 puzzels that I found on the Internet.  I am
working to fix that.
